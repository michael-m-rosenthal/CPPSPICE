In the context of mathematics, there are certain words that you should be weary of.
One of those words is the word `fundamental`.
If anyone ever asks you a *fundamental* question, it is usually wise to proceed cautiously and honestly within the limitations of your current understanding.
Usually, something that is fundamental is not easy to explain adequately without some profound level of understanding.
The same thing is true for the fundamental theorem of calculus.

Imagine for a moment that you have a two thin pieces of square glass panes of the same size with a small gap in between them.
Imagine that there is a water-tight border connecting these two panes of glass surrounding the perimeter.
Now imagine that you fill this vessel half way with water so that the area below the waterline comprises of half the total area of the glass square.

Now imagine that you take a marker and draw a straight vertical line from the top of the glass to the bottom of the somewhere on the glass.
The area below the waterline to the left of the vertical line that you drew will be less than half of the total area of the glass square.
Similarly, the area below the waterline to the right of the vertical line that you drew will be less than half of the total area of the glass square.
Now imagine that you carefully compute the area below the water line to the left vertical line you drew.
Then image that you do the same thing to the right of the vertical line you drew.
If you add the two areas you computed, what do you expect to get?
It is just half the total area of the glass square, right?

Water is not very easy to compress.
If you were to try and physically compress water with some *clever* device, the mechanism by which you are compressing the water is prone to catastrophically fail before you can significantly compress the water.
If you pour it from one cup to another cup, the volume remains the same.


So, if you gently shook the glass around and made waves appear at the waterline, the area below the waterline to the left vertical line plus the area below the waterline to the right of the vertical line would still always be half of the total area of the glass square at all times.

Image that you took a picture of the waterline in motion so that you could measure the divided areas below the waterline.
If you carefully measure the total area that is below the waterline to the left of the vertical line you drew, then you do not need to carefully measure the area to the right of the waterline if you know that the total area below the waterline is half of the total area of the glass square.
You can just subtract what you measured from the left from the total area under the waterline.

The fundamental theorem of calculus certainly implies that this is the case, and this is how it is commonly used for computing definite integrals.
But it also tells us considerably more than this.
It tells us that definite integration is an anti-derivative.
To explain this, we would need to understand what about what a definite integral is, and that requires an understanding of what a limit is, and some intuition about some common cases for limits which are known to converge.
These are the kinds of things that they typically teach in an introductory calculus course.
With these tools, you could probably understand the fundamental theorem of calculus within the context of Riemann integration.
However, to really understand the fundamental theorem of calculus, your need to know much more than that.
You will need know some topics that you typically learn from real analysis, and then you will need to understand some measure theory.
With these tools and some persistence, you may be able to acquire an appreciation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
